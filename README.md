Broker program displaying use of Array to store StockTrade Obj


  Just tring to get a better grasp on using GitHub while also displaying my code. This was code was originally
as part of my assignments for my course work. My current goal is to include all the modifications that were made
throughout the corse. Some of this will stay the same while displaying implementations of various algorithms.
Keep in mind many of these were Assignments and they were meant to follow certain guidelines in order to 
complicate the implementations and ensure more exposure to different concepts and difficulties while 
programming. Due to this fact the implementation and strategies used may seem a bit contrived at times.

With this in mind I always enjoy expanding my knowledge, so I always appreciate recommendations and suggestions.
